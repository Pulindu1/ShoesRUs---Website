Responsiveness: I have made pictures and graph adjust size with minimisation of page, but left text to stay the same, so that the text can still be readable at minimised window.
--------------------------
Data set: I have a separate JSON file as requested, however I had major problems when linking the file to my JS file (all JS functions would stop working as intended), so I hardcoded the data for my graph.
--------------------------
eslint: I have installed eslint as a extension for VScode. And I have used it to fix most problems picked up. It is included I the zip file however when saving it, a pop up stated that since the file name began with a '.', it'll be hidden. But the following are the rules:

module.exports = {
    extends: 'standard',
    rules: {
        semi: [2, 'always'],
        indent: 'off'
    },
    "settings":{
        "react":{
            "version": "detect"
        }
    }
};
